# Pyramid Word Checker (Fetch Rewards)

I have used Node and Express to create this service.
Before starting, make sure that Node is installed in your machine.
Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install latest version of node


## Once node is installed, follow these steps:

1. From the terminal, switch to the directory where you want to download the repo.

2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/prajeet21/FetchRewardsPyramidWord.git
```

3. This will create a new _**FetchRewardsPyramidWord**_ directory and then go into this new directory

```
cd FetchRewardsPyramidWord
```

4. Then install the necessary dependencies using the following command.

```
npm install
```

5. Finally, run the app in your local machine using the command:

```
node index.js
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to test it in the browser.

Submitting a word in the text field will send a post request to the root route where the checking will be done on the backend; and appropriate message will be displayed below the button.
